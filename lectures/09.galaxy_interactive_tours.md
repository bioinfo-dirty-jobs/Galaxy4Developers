## How to create a Galaxy Interactive Tour?
An Interactive Tour is easy to create: just a [YAML file]({{site.url}}/assets/core.galaxy_ui.yaml) to fill
```yaml
id: galaxy_ui
name: Galaxy UI
description: A gentle introduction to the Galaxy User Interface
title_default: "Welcome to Galaxy"

# A tour is made of several steps, each of them beginning with a dash '-'
steps:
    # 'title's will be displayed in the header of each step-container
    # If you don't specify any title, a default title is used, defined above.
    - title: "Welcome to Galaxy"
      # 'content' is the actual text that is shown to the user
      content: "This short tour will guide you through Galaxy's user interface.<br>
                You can navigate with your arrow keys and leave the tour at any time point with 'Escape' or the 'End tour' button."
      # backdrop is just one of many properties you can attach to one step-container,
      # a full reference can be found at http://bootstraptour.com/api/
      backdrop: true

    # 'element' is the JQuery Selector (http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/) of the element you want to describe
    # In this case we want to highlight the Upload button with the `.upload-button` selector
    - title: "Upload your data"
      element: ".upload-button"
      intro: "Galaxy supports many ways to get in your data.<br>
              Use this button to upload your data."
      # position of the text box relative to the selected element
      position: "right"
      # You can trigger click() events on arbitrary elements before (preclick) or after (postclick) the element is shown
      postclick:
        - ".upload-button"

    - title: "Upload your data"
      element: "#btn-local"
      intro: "You can upload data from your computer."
      position: "top"
      postclick:
        - "#btn-new"

    - title: "Upload your data"
      element: "#btn-new"
      intro: "Copy and paste data directly into Galaxy or include URLs that lead to your data"
      position: "top"
```
