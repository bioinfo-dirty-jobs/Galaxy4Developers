### Hands-on 1

**Goal**:  
Developing a simple FASTQ2FASTA converter using [Seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk), a tool for processing sequence data in FASTA and
 FASTQ files

*Before*:  
observe and test Seqtk

```bash
$ seqtk
$ seqtk seq
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-test-data/master/2.fastq
$ cat 2.fastq
$ seqtk seq -A 2.fastq > 2.fasta
$ cat 2.fasta
```

*Steps*:

1. Create a new directory for your tool, cd into it
2. Init the wrapper with planemo tool_init
3. Fill the template 
4. Check the syntax with planemo lint
5. Display the tool with planemo serve
6. Try it with a file


### Hands-on 2

**Goal**:  
Improve your FASTQ2FASTA wrapper.

*Steps*:  
Fill (seriously :) the template (planemo tool_init --help)
7. Have you added tool xml version?
8. Have you added command version?
9. Have you added requirements?
10. Have you added help section?
11. Have you added citations section?
12. Have you generated a test case?
13. Check the syntax with planemo lint
14. Test the template with planemo test


### Hands-on 3

**Goal**:  
Publish  your new shiny wrapper to the test toolshed.

*Steps*:
15. Configure a shed account
16. Create a toolshed repository
17. Update your wrapper then check diff between the shed repository and your 
local copy
18. Update the shed repository
