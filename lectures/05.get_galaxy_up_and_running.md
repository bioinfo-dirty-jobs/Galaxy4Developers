## Reasons to Install Your Own Galaxy

You need to download Galaxy if you plan to:

* Run a local production Galaxy because you want to
    * Install and use tools unavailable on public Galaxies
    * Use sensitive data (e.g. clinical)
    * Process large datasets that are too big for public Galaxies
    * Plug-in new datasources
* Develop Galaxy tools
* Develop Galaxy itself

## Requirements
* Any Linux or Mac OS
* [Python 2.7](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/python/)

### Optionals
* samtools (metadata etc.)
* Git code versioning system
* GNU Make + gcc to compile and install tool dependencies
* Additional requirements for shipped tools


## Get Started
### For Production or Single User

If setting up or running a production Galaxy service or creating your own personal Galaxy instance, 
use the [latest release](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/) branch, which only receives stable code updates.

#### Cloning new

If you do not have a Galaxy repository yet or you do not want to update the existing instance, run:
```bash
$ git clone -b release_17.05 https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git
```

#### Updating exiting

If you have an existing Galaxy repository and want to update it, run:
```bash
$ git checkout release_17.05 && git pull --ff-only origin release_17.05
```

### For Development
To obtain Galaxy for development, use the default branch after cloning: `dev`. 
This is the branch that pull requests should be made against to contribute code (unless you are fixing a bug in a Galaxy release).

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git
```

## Start It Up
To start Galaxy, simply run the following commands:
```bash
$ cd galaxy && sh run.sh
```

This will start up the Galaxy server on `localhost` and port `8080`. 
Galaxy can then be accessed from a web browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). 

### What happened?
* Galaxy started logging into the terminal from which it is run.
* Galaxy created a Python virtual environment (venv) in `.venv/`.
* Galaxy sourced this environment (`$ source .venv/bin/activate`)
* Galaxy fetched needed Python binaries ('wheels') into this environment.
* Galaxy created the default SQLite database and migrated it to the latest version.
* Galaxy bound to the default port `8080` on `localhost`.

All of the above can be configured.

### Look around
* Run a basic job (e.g. upload a file).
* Check [http://localhost:8080/api/version](http://localhost:8080/api/version) to see Galaxy's version.


### Stopping Galaxy
To stop the Galaxy server, use `Ctrl-C` in the terminal window from which Galaxy is running.

### Start/stop in the background
#### Start
```bash
$ sh run.sh --daemon
  ...
Activating virtualenv at .venv
Entering daemon mode
```
#### Monitor
```bash
$ tail -f paster.log
  ...
Starting server in PID 1469.
serving on http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
#### Stop
```bash
$ sh run.sh --stop-daemon
```
## Basic configuration
* Galaxy works out of the box with default configuration.
* Most important config files are in `config/`.
    * [galaxy.ini](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/galaxy.ini.sample) Main configuration file
    * [datatypes_conf.xml](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/datatypes_conf.xml.sample) List of data types available
    * [tool_conf.xml](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/tool_conf.xml.sample) Tools configuration file
    * [tool_shed.ini](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/tool_shed.ini.sample) Tool Shed configuration file
    * [tool_sheds_conf.xml](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/tool_sheds_conf.xml.sample) List of tools installed from Tool Shed 
* Galaxy often uses the files with suffix `*.sample` as declared defaults.

### Make your own config 
* Copy the provided sample and open editor.
```bash
$ cp config/galaxy.ini.sample config/galaxy.ini
$ nano config/galaxy.ini
```

* Uncomment/Set the following entries.
```bash
message_box_visible = True
message_box_content = "Hey, at least I'm not a popup!"
message_box_class = info
```

* (Re)start Galaxy
## Next Steps
### Become an Admin
To control Galaxy through the UI (installing tools, managing users, creating groups, etc.), users must become an administrator. 
Only registered users can become admins. To give a user admin privileges, complete the following steps:

* Create an account (User -> Register)
* Create a user using Galaxy interface.
* Add the user's Galaxy login email to the configuration file config/galaxy.ini. As shown here:
```bash
# this should be a comma-separated list of valid Galaxy users
admin_users = user1@example.com,user2@example.com
```
* (Re)start Galaxy.


### Update the welcome page
Welcome page is `$GALAXY_ROOT/static/welcome.html` and is the first thing that users see. It is a good idea to extend it with things like:

* Downtimes/Maintenance periods
* New tools
* Publications relating to your Galaxy

No restarting is necessary.

### Install Tools
Galaxy comes with a small set of basic tools pre-installed. 
To install additional tools, follow the instructions on [Installing tools into Galaxy from the Tool Shed](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/tools/add-tool-from-toolshed-tutorial/).

### Join the Mailing List
To stay up-to-date on new Galaxy features and bug fixes, as well as to discuss future features, consider joining the [Galaxy Developers mailing list](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/listinfo/galaxy-dev/).
See [Mailing Lists](https://galaxyproject.org/mailing-lists/) for other options.

### Keep your instance backed up
Like any other application, Galaxy directories and Galaxy database tables should be backed up, and any disaster recovery plans should be regularly tested to make sure everything is working as expected.

### Configure for production
The above instructions are intended for users wishing to develop Galaxy tools and Galaxy itself. 
To deploy a production-ready installation of Galaxy, some changes from the default configuration are highly recommended. 
If nothing else, switching to PostgreSQL or MySQL (from the default SQLite) is heavily endorsed to prevent database locking issues that can arise with multiple users.

Please see the [Running Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/performance/production-server/) in a production environment page for more details.

### Keep your code up to date
Galaxy development occurs in [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/). 
Changes are stabilized in the `release_YY.MM` branches and then merged to `master` for each `YY.MM.point` release

At any time, you can check to see if a new stable release is available by using the `git log` command:
```bash
$ git log ..origin/master
commit 3a2ff46c28172ef78510f4bea2f4be75ce660667
Merge: 8b538f17f 90de3f258
Author: Martin Cech <cech.marten@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 22 10:56:57 2017 -0500

    Merge branch 'release_17.01'
```
If git log produces no output, Galaxy is up-to-date. If git log produces a list of commits, a new version is available.
You can pull the commits to your local Galaxy clone with:
```bash
$ git pull
```
